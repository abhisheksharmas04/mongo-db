Many to Many Association: 
	We can take List or Map Collection type properties as the HAS-A properties in the Document to build One to Many or
	Many to many association.
	
	if the has a properties type is list or set collection then the document looks like:
		{
			id: ..
			...
			... // Parent property
			Has A property: [
								{....} {...}
							]
		}
	if the has a propertie type is Map collection then the document looks like this:
		{
			id: ..
			....
			...
			..
			Has A property:{
				{.....}
				{......}
			}
		}
		
		One person can have multiple visa (one to many), One Person can have multiple vehicles
		
		One Document can have multiple has a properties representing multiple types of associations with child documents
